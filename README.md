# Coupon-RMI
Generate a coupon using user input and RMI <br />

This program was made using instructions from a practice test in my second year at Seneca College for my BTP400 class. <br /> <br />


Navigate to the server directory using a terminal. <br />
Type: javac -cp .;../common CouponServer.java <br />
      java -cp .;../common CouponServer <br />
      
Open up another terminal and navigate to the client directory. <br />
Type: javac -cp .;../common CoupnClient.java <br />
      java -cp .;../common CoupnClient <br />
